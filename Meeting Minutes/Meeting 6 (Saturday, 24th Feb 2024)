- Discussed the feedback received for project part 2
- Discussed the requirements for project part 3 and roughly decided which user stories should be done for the half-way check point 
- Ryan and Shraddha will be working on the login page, editing profile and welcome page for all the users(administrator, organizer, attendee)
- Dennis and Akib will be working on QR code generation, reusing QR codes and hopefully sharing as well
- Gitanjali and Harshita will be working on the administrator UI stories for browsing and deleting events (if figured out, can be extended to images and profiles as well)
